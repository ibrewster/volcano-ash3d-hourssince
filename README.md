HoursSince
==========

HoursSince is a collection of functions and subroutines that calculate
the number of hours of a given calendar date from Jan. 1 of a reference year.
These functions were written as a component of the USGS volcanic ash
transport and dispersion model, Ash3d.  However, since they are useful for
other programs outside of Ash3d, they are collected into a stand-along file
that can either be compiled as a library or simply compiled directly with
other source code.

To compile as a library, simple type:

  make

Some subroutines in HoursSince.f90 have stand-alone wrapper programs, using 1900
as the base year for the hours calculation.
  HoursSince1900
  yyyymmddhh_since_1900

To compile these wrapper programs, type:

  make tools

To install the library, edit the INSTALLDIR variable of the makefile (the
default is /opt/USGS) and type:

  make install

You will need to have write permission in ${INSTALLDIR} or install as root.
